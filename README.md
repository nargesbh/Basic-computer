## Introduction


This endeavor is the culmination of my efforts in a Computer Organization course.
My primary objective was to conceptualize and construct a fully operational CPU (Central Processing Unit) replete with an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
and other pivotal components.

### Hardware Components

My CPU architecture comprises a plethora of vital hardware components, including:

- **Memory Unit**: With a generous capacity of 4096 words, each consisting of 16 bits.
- **Registers**: A collection of nine registers: AR, PC, DR, AC, IR, TR, OUTR, INPR, and SC.
- **Flip-Flops**: A complement of seven flip-flops: I, S, E, R, lEN, FGI, and FGO.
- **Decoders**: Encompassing a 3 x 8 operation decoder and a 4 x 16 timing decoder.
- **Common Bus**: A robust 16-bit common data bus, facilitating seamless data transfer.
- **Control Logic Gates**: An intricate network of logic gates responsible for data flow and operations.
- **Adder and Logic Circuit**: Meticulously connected to the input of AC, these components facilitate arithmetic and logic operations.
